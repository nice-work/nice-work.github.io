      <h2>Ray Lansburg and Lindsay Thompson make things out of leather. Good things. Really good things.</h2>
      <h3>Ray and Lindsay are The Blackacre.</h3>

        Ray Lansburg and Lindsay Thompson knew that they would form <a href="http://www.theblackacre.net" target="_blank">The Blackacre</a>
        before they knew what The Blackacre would be. Friends of two decades,
        their shared penchant for artistry drove them towards design-oriented
        pursuits. They dabbled in t-shirts and photography (primarily of metal
        bands in Los Angeles, naturally) before discovering a love for and
        fascination with leather. Both speak of leather’s tactility, tangibility
        and natural origins with a reverence that is a testament to their deep
        personal understanding of the material.

        Ray has the kind of casual nonchalance that can only be born of being
        accustomed to doing something so well for long enough to no longer see
        it as extraordinary. He just does it. His hands know what they’re doing:
        the perfect tension required for a certain stitch in a specific spot
        is programmed into his fingers. But his nonchalant adroitness transcends
        the routinized tasks of his craft – it seems to define the way he reflects
        on anything he has done or is doing.

        “Yeah, I built a motorcycle one time. I’m just one of those guys I guess
        – I can look at something, read a book about it, and then just make it.”

      Get him talking about something new, though – something rapidly breaching
      the horizon, just beyond his current scope of mastery – and the excitement
      pours out of him. It’s a spontaneous enthusiasm unexpected from a
      seasoned, well-practiced craftsman. This is a man who thrills in treading
      new and uncertain ground, and in approaching perfection with an uncanny
      rapidity – making the rest of us look borderline inept in the process.

      For Lindsay – a working architect – conception and design are bread and
      butter. His love for his work as an architect is clear, but leatherwork
      fills a need by allowing him to take a designer’s final steps: execution
      and delivery. In his architectural work – he explains – he conceives and
      designs. Once his final designs are drafted, however, his work is
      finished. With The Blackacre, Lindsay is afforded the opportunity to
      conceive and design, but then to proceed through execution: construction,
      and delivery of a physical object to its end user.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Blackacre workshop occupies a space behind Ray’s home in Fullerton,
      California. Part of a once-working automobile shop built in the 1920s, the
      room and its surrounds have a feel of repurposed purpose-built.

      While many of any week’s evenings find Lindsay in the Blackacre workshop,
      Ray is in the workshop every day – and often all day. For him The
      Blackacre is both daydream and day-job. While their process is truly
      collaborative, each man brings clear and unique strengths to the
      workbench.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lindsay laughs as he states that more often than not a new product is born of
      Ray stating unequivocally that he’s no longer happy with a current design.
      This dissatisfaction with a product’s status quo is born of Ray’s insatiable
      need to learn more about his craft – in a tone equal parts ribbing and
      admiring, Lindsay deems his friend the “researching madman.”

      Triggered by Ray’s product declamation, a conversation ensues and evolves
      over days or weeks. A new design idea is iterated over multiple meetings –
      concept is hammered out in conversation, after which each man
      independently drafts his interpretation. When the drawings are brought
      back together, design discrepancies become the focus of continued
      discussion, and the process repeats until equilibrium is achieved.
      “Compromise,” Ray names it, glancing sidelong at Lindsay. Lindsay grins.
      They know each other well.

      The boys of The Blackacre are nothing if not perfectionists. The
      brilliance and beauty of their products are testaments to their
      unwillingness to compromise on any part of their design vision and
      process. The elements that define a design of The Blackacre serve both to
      reveal Ray and Lindsay’s aesthetics and to demonstrate their considerable
      skill in  working with leather. Organic curves, minimal straight edges and
      double-needle stitching highlight the skill with which The Blackacre’s
      products are hand-assembled. Heavily burnished edges and tall pockets are
      intended to highlight the natural beauty of their chosen medium. No design
      element is come upon by accident – everything a user experiences with his
      Blackacre product is the result of a decision Ray and Lindsay have
      agonized over and argued about, over beers, in the Blackacre workshop.

      There’s a genuineness about the way Ray and Lindsay carry themselves; an
      honesty and fidelity that translate to the leather objects they make. They are
      not satisfied to just make something to the best of their abilities – it is
      only worth their effort if they are making something that can stand as an
      emblem to what can be accomplished with the medium they have chosen.
